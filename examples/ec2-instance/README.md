# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is an example EC2 instance CDK application.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app,
so be sure to open it and change these variables to your own:

APP_NAME
VPC_ID
SUBNET_ID
IMAGE_ID
KEY_NAME

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
